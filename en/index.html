<h2>
  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
</h2>

<p>
  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (or BJJ) is a martial art which came from Judo and
  Japanese Jiu-Jitsu. Since its inception in the 1920’s in Brazil, this combat
  sport is booming all over the world.
</p>

<p>
  BJJ focuses on ground fighting and the use of joint-locks or chokeholds to
  defeat an opponent rather than using striking techniques. This is a strategy
  and a combat art which allows anyone, no matter the size or weight, to defeat
  a stronger and heavier opponent. BJJ enables anybody to develop his/her own
  fighting style.

<p>
  While the discipline is a tried and tested self-defence method, everyone can
  enjoy it on its own terms. Whether you come for the strategic mindgame of the
  fights or to get in better shape, we’re sure BJJ has something for you.
