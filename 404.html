	This tends to happen when I move post around categories so you might find what you're looking for in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/reviews.html">reviews</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/learning.html">learning</a> or <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/explorations.html">explorations</a> categories. You can also try your luck on the <a href=""></a>home page. Since there's no search engine you'll either have to use a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ayannick-lohse.fr%2Fbjj">google feature</a> or ctrl/cmd + F.
</p>

	Also, I'm sorry about that. I hope you'll be curious enough to search for the content you wanted — it's probably not far away. Here are a couple of articles that people tend to search for:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/learning/2014/07/22/reversed-bjj-paradigm.html">The Reversed BJJ Paradigm</a>, an article about another way to learn BJJ
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/learning/2014/07/17/learning.html">Learning</a>, another aticle about learning BJJ but in the form of an actual lesson
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	❤, Yannick.
